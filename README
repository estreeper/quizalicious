This is a simple quizzing application that works like flashcards.

You store question and answer pairs to form quizzes. Based on whether you get a question right
or not, you will have a lesser or greater chance of seeing it again. For instance, if you get
a question right, the probability of you seeing that question again is reduced. This way you see
the questions you're worse at more often.
